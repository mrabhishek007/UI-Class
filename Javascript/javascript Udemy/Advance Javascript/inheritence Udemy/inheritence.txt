  Inheritance is achieved in javascript by using prototypes

 Every javascript object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in javascript

 The prototype properties of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit

 The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself.it's the prototype of all instances that are created through it 

 When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if cannot be found, the search moves on
    the object's prototype.This continues until the method is found : PROTOTYPE CHAIN
